# Portfolio-optimization
Optimized a stock portfolio using historical data, various optimization techniques, and machine learning to maximize returns and manage risk.

1.Retrieved and analyzed historical stock data (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA) using yfinance to assess asset performance over time.
2.Used efficient frontier visualization and Sharpe ratio maximization (SLSQP, GA) to find optimal portfolio weights balancing risk and return.
3.Conducted backtesting to evaluate the performance of the optimized portfolio versus an equal-weighted one, focusing on returns and volatility.
4.Integrated a neural network model for predicting future returns, enhancing portfolio decision-making with machine learning insights.
